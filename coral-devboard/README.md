# Google Coral Dev Board

The Google Coral Dev Board is a Quad-core symmetric Cortex-A53 processors (with GPU and VPU) and an Edge TPU coprocessor as low-power ML acceleror (4 TOPS, 2 TOPS per watt). The 40x48mm system-on-module (SoM) included with the Dev Board is based on NXP's iMX 8M system-on-chip (SoC) and contains all the essential system hardware, including the Edge TPU and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth radios. It is attached to the Dev Board baseboard with three 100-pin board-to-board connectors. Network interfaces include Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi and Bluetooh 4.2 (including BLE). The board had a MicroSD slot and connectors for camera, audio, external stereo speakers, video (HDMI), USB-C and USB Micro-B for serial console. GPIO are available on the 40-pin I/O header.
