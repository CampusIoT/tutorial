# CampusIoT :: Tutoriel sur le STM32WL (SoC STM32 and SX1262)

## STM32WLE5
STM32WLE5 microcontrollers comply with the physical layer requirements of the LoRaWAN® specification released by the LoRa Alliance®. Available LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK and BPSK modulations can also be used in legacy and proprietary protocols.

The radio is suitable for systems targeting compliance with radio regulations including, but not limited to, ETSI EN 300 220, FCC CFR 47 Part 15, China regulatory requirements and the Japanese ARIB T-108. Continuous frequency coverage from 150 to 960 MHz enables the support of all major sub-GHz ISM bands around the world.

System peripherals :The STM32WLE5 line includes a wide variety of communication features including up to 43 GPIOs, an integrated SMPS for power consumption optimization, multiple low-power modes to maximize battery life. A dual-power output and a wide linear frequency range ensure worldwide compatibility.

Security & ID : In addition to its wireless and ultra-low-power features, STM32WL microcontrollers include embedded security hardware functions such as 128- / 256-bit AES hardware encryption, PCROP read / write protection, and public-key cryptography with an elliptic curve encryption engine.
