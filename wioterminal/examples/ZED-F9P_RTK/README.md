# RTK examples with Wio Terminal


* Wio Terminal
* Grove Cable
* ZED-F9P module : we use the Mikrobus one
* GPS outdoor antenna

* A Wifi access point (for the NTRIPServer)

Connect the ZED-F9P module to the I2C Grove Connector of the WioTerminal

    pin 1 - Yellow (for example, SCL on I2C Grove Connectors)
    pin 2 - White (for example, SDA on I2C Grove Connectors)
    pin 3 - Red - VCC on all Grove Connectors
    pin 4 - Black - GND on all Grove Connectors


As part of our ever growing Arduino u-blox GNSS library, weâ€™ve added a NTRIP Server example (located under ... -> examples -> ZED-F9P -> Example14_NTRIPServer).
